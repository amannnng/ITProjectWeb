            <td><p>Research and teaching are complementary and equally important. Research contributes to the production of knowledge, while teaching is concerned with the distribution of knowledge in society. Teaching without research quickly becomes stereotyped, unexciting --removed from the ever growing frontiers of knowledge, while research without teaching becomes unintelligible and uncommunicative. Continuous interaction with fresh minds through teaching makes research more proactive and highly productive..
				
				<br><br>At the UTSA College of Business, we share a commitment to research and publications, which positions us well to absorb quality faculty and students. Research is part of a learning cycle, significantly contributing to the absorption of quality students and retention of quality faculty yielding an institution of higher learning that continuously strives for excellence.
				
				<br><br>UTSA College of Business faculty members are conducting research throughout a variety of disciplines and have been recognized by their peers for their accomplishments. The Department of Marketing was ranked 35th nationally, the Department of Accounting was ranked 64th nationally and the Department of Management Science and Statistics was ranked 81st nationally for their research publications according to UT Dallas research rankings for 2015-2016.
				
				<br><br>Innovation needs to be part of the culture at UTSA and embedded in all research planning, processes and infrastructure. Highlighting the importance of funded research, UTSA is putting in place training for faculty, establishing research service centers to support faculty research and creating incentives to encourage faculty to conduct both funded and non-funded research.
